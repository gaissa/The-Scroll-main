Cannabis and AI both alter how we process information—but in very different ways. Cannabis slows things down. It can stretch perception, soften focus, and make ordinary thoughts feel novel or significant. AI speeds things up, compressing vast amounts of data into quick answers, patterns, and predictions.

What they share is their influence on attention. Cannabis often narrows it, pulling the mind into specific sensations or ideas. AI expands it outward, offering endless inputs and possibilities at once. In both cases, the risk is similar: losing track of what actually matters.

There’s also a question of creativity. Cannabis can make connections feel more fluid, but not necessarily more accurate. AI can generate ideas instantly, but without any real understanding behind them. Both can assist creativity, but neither replaces the discipline needed to shape something meaningful.

Together, they highlight a tension in modern thinking: the desire to feel more and think faster at the same time. But clarity doesn’t come from amplification alone—it comes from knowing when to slow down, question, and filter what you experience
