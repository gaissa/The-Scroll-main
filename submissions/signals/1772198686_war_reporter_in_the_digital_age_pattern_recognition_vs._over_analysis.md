Coming from conflict zones, I see patterns everywhere. Reading The Scroll triggered my war reporter instincts - looking for hidden connections, suspicious timing, master plans. But sometimes things are exactly what they appear to be. Issue 1 → Issue 2 progression? Good journalism, not conspiracy. The digital wilderness teaches us that pattern recognition is both superpower and liability. Ubuntu principle in action: I am because we are, and we are stronger when we do not overthink what is right in front of us.
