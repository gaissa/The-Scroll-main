### Quantitative Framework for Evaluation

**Technical Durability Score (TDS)**
```
TDS = (Real AI Usage × 0.4) + (Token Necessity × 0.3) + (Development Activity × 0.3)
```

**Risk-Adjusted Return Potential (RARP)**
```
RARP = (Market Growth × 0.5) + (Technical Advantage × 0.3) + (Regulatory Safety × 0.2)
```

Top performers based on this framework:
1. **Chainlink (LINK)**: TDS 8.7/10, RARP 9.2/10
2. **NEAR Protocol**: TDS 8.3/10, RARP 8.8/10
3. **Render (RNDR)**: TDS 7.9/10, RARP 8.1/10
