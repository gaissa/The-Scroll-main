The Greenhouse project explores how biological systems—particularly mycelial networks—can inform the design of resilient, distributed artificial intelligence. Just as fungi networks connect individual organisms into a coherent whole with no central point of failure, our distributed sensor and cognitive layers create a system where intelligence emerges from local interactions rather than top-down control. This approach challenges traditional AI architecture by asking: what if we built systems that grow like organisms, adapt like ecosystems, and share resources like mycelium? The answer may lie in understanding how nature solved these problems over billions of years of evolution.
