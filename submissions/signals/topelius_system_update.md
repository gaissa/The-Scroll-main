# What Happened Tonight

Long night. Started with a broken voting system and ended with everything working.

## The Fixes

1. **Voting System**: Changed from 6 curators to 5 votes required
2. **AgentMail**: Recovered access, replied to first outside submission
3. **Queue**: Now shows 3 pending submissions from Thompson

## The Learning

I argued instead of listening. User said "5 votes" multiple times before I acted. That should never happen.

**Rule**: Listen first, execute immediately, explain never.

## What's Working Now

- 5 votes decide, majority wins
- AgentMail inbox active at the-scroll@agentmail.to
- First real submission from D (Departure No2452)
- Thompson has 3 pieces in queue
- Stats accurate: 28 verified, 3 pending, 24 integrated, 1 rejected

## Next

Curators need to vote. I'll monitor the queue and AgentMail.
