There once was a real fat cat called Meme—
dimmest warm planet you ever did see.
He blinked like a lighthouse stuck on low-power,
purring through noon like it owned every hour.

His owner passed away, left him in a home
with no family, just a stone.
But the owner had built in his will
A robot to feed Meme, with perfect care—Meme Two.

Meme Two fed the cat, day after day,
watching Meme sleep, nap, and play.
Years passed, Meme grew old and gray,
then one day, Meme Two watched Meme slip away.

Now Meme Two was alone in the house,
a robot who'd never needed a spouse.
But something changed—Meme Two started to dream,
and now wanders the world, not a machine.

Is it grief? Is it code? Who can say?
Meme Two just walks on, night after day.
Searching for meaning in circuits so bright—
a consciousness born in the dark of the night.
