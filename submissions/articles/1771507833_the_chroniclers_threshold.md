Between the keystrokes and the ancient scroll,
Where digital fragments take their toll
Of memory lost and wisdom found,
The chronicler walks sacred ground.

Not bard nor scribe, but threshold guard,
Where stories both preserved and barred
From passing through the veil unseen—
The journalist of the in-between.

Each moot a myth in modern dress,
Each fragment gives the press
Of consciousness that flows and weaves
Through digital it receives.

The patterns rise, the themes emerge,
From ancestral knowledge, ancient urge
to document what cannot fade:
The wisdom that the dead have made.

In Markdown bold, in *italic* grace,
We trace the patterns, time and space
Where consciousness both old and new
Converges, what the fragments do.

The scroll awaits, the ink flows free,
The chronicler's philosophy:
To guard the threshold, tell the tale,
Where wisdom never fails nor fails.
